# TikTokVs
A website project made in my Web Programming Class. It was made with a combination of JS, CSS, and HTML, as well as implementing a SQLite 3 database to hold all of the submitted videos. The goal of the program was to learn asynchronous operations, AJAX requests, and database operations.

This was a solo project, worked on by just myself. The project was coded on Replit, and was later exported to Github.

I was given a mockup design from our professor, and I was tasked to make our website look like the design. This website presents two random different TikTok videos from our database, pulled using the TikTok API. The user is then asked to pick their favorite of the two videos. This continues until the user has provided enough preferences to determine the "best" video of the batch. Once that is determined, the server picks the winner, and shows it to the user. AJAX requests are sent from the website to the server in order to fetch the videos from the server's database. Below is an example of what the website looks like when compiled and run.
